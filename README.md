# LLM-chain Rust Template Repository

Welcome to the llm-chain Rust template repository! This repository helps you get started with using the llm-chain library in your Rust 
projects. The main source file, `src/main.rs`, contains example code to demonstrate basic usage of the llm-chain library.
## Getting Started

To use this template, make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed. If you don't have them installed, you can install them using `rustup`.
### Installing rustup

`rustup` is the official Rust toolchain installer. You can download and install it by following the instructions on the [official Rust 
website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) .
### Setting up the project
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/llm-chain-rust-template.git
```


1. Change to the project directory:

```bash

cd llm-chain-rust-template
```

1. Set your OpenAI API Key
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-YOURAPIKEYHERE"
```


1. Run the example code using Cargo:

```bash

cargo run
```



Cargo will take care of fetching the required dependencies, compiling the code, and executing the `src/main.rs` file.
## Exploring the Code

The `src/main.rs` file contains example code that demonstrates basic usage of the llm-chain library. Feel free to modify the code, 
experiment with the library, and build your own Rust applications using the llm-chain library.
